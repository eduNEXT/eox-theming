# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v8.1.0](https://github.com/eduNEXT/eox-theming/compare/v8.0.0...v8.1.0) - (2024-11-27)

### Changed

- **Sumac Support**: Upgrade requirements base on edx-platform Sumac
release and update integration tests to use new Sumac release with Tutor.

## v8.0.0 - 2024-10-22

## [v8.0.0](https://github.com/eduNEXT/eox-theming/compare/v7.2.0...v8.0.0) - (2024-10-22)

#### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Dropped Support for Django 3.2**: Removed support for Django 3.2 in this plugin. As a result, we have also dropped support for Open edX releases from Maple up to and including Palm, which rely on Django 3.2. Future versions of this plugin may not be compatible with these Open edX releases.

## v7.2.0 - 2024-07-24

### Changed
- **Redwood Support**: The `requirements` have been updated in line with the `edx-platform` Redwood release. Additionally, the `GitHub workflows` dependencies have been upgraded to the latest functional versions, and various documentation sections have been revised.

### Fixed
- **Django templates were not found according to the THEME_OPTIONS definition**: The issue occurred because the `get_theme_template_sources` method only returns the directory for the current theme, then if this directory doesn't exist, the default template is returned instead ([issue #9](https://github.com/eduNEXT/eox-release/issues/9)). This problem was resolved by executing the `get_theme_template_sources` method from the `EoxThemeFilesystemLoader`, which retrieves the template directories not only for the current theme but also for its parent and grandparent themes.
